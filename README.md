# Measure an ECG with an Arduino Uno and the Olimex-EKG-EMG-Shield and calculate the heart rate variability

For the measurement of the heart-rate-variability it is necessary to measure an ECG first. This is done with three electrodes attached to the left arm, the right arm and the left foot. Those electrodes are the inputs for the Olimex-EKG-EMG-Shield, which is used as a hat for the Arduino Uno Rev3.
